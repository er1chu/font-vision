# Font Vision [WIP]

`Work In Progress ðŸš§`

Visual font explorer powered by the FontsInUse API, built on:
Typescript + Zodios | Tailwind | Next

The stack takes cues from the [init.tips](https://init.tips) stack, also known as the T3-Stack but instead of tRPC, it uses [Zodios](https://github.com/ecyrbe/zodios) to ensure end to end typesafety.

After adding your FontsInUse API keys and AppID as environment variables run `pnpm install && pnpm run dev`
